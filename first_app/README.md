# First App

This is the very first app that contains the following important lessons:
- **Widget Tree**: It refers to how widgets live within one onother. There would be a *root widget* within which all widgets would be nested, which in turn may have further nested widgets. This all can be visualised as a tree.
- **Fonts**: The `pubspec.yaml` file needs to have the `fonts` YAML emtry added under `flutter` to detect the paths of all fonts. They can later be used within the style property as strings.
- **Dart**: The programming language on which Flutter is based. The `dart` directory describes some basic concepts commonly used in working with this framework.
