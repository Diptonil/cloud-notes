# My Notes

This is the second app in series and it deals with the following lessons:
- **Colors**: The `Color` class is the primary class that is used to manipulate colours. We have a set of predefined colours that we can reference by the respective names (as a sort of wrapper for convenience). That is denoted by `Colors`.
- **Underscores in Variables**: In Dart, we use underscores for making a variable private to that particular class. Variables inside a function shouldn't use '_' for variables, since it is already private for that function.
- **Scaffold**: The Scaffold is designed to be a top level container for a MaterialApp. It is the top-level class, basically. Everything is heirarchially under it. Nesting it is not a good idea, no matter what the use case. The docs say this.
