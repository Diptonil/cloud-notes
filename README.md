# Example Apps for Flutter

This repository contains simple demo apps for learning the intricacies of the framework, with each type of app properly documented along with the prime lesson learnt with it.


## Dart

The `dart` directory documents some starters about the language that can be used to operate the framework well.


## Apps

1. **Abstraction** (*first_app*): A lesson in making the first Flutter app.
    - Just uses `StatelessWidgets` (no state of the app to be saved).
    - Minimal and the least bit of code.
    - Deals mostly with the starter concepts of reloads, widget trees, state, etc.
1. **All in All** (*addition*): A lesson in creating layouts using Material UI.
    - Still uses `StatelessWidgets` (no state of the app to be saved).
    - Focusses a lot in layouts and structure.
    - Codebase structured and organized as in standard Flutter projects.
    - Incorporates local file storage.
