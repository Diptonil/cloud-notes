# Example Apps for Flutter

This repository contains simple demo apps for learning the intricacies of the framework, with each type of app properly documented along with the prime lesson learnt with it.


## Flutter

- It is a UI framework developed by Google built for cross-platform apps that are highly performant.


## Dart

The `dart` directory documents some starters about the language that can be used to operate the framework well.


## Developer Accounts

In the initial stages of development, the need for these accounts won't seem apparent. But it is good practice to start with them, if possible financially.
- The Google Play Developer account is what gives you the ability to make your app available on the Play Store for Android users.
- An Apple Developer Account enables users to publish and manage iOS apps on the Apple App Store.
- There are two types: Individual and Organizational.
- Whatever the case is, this step is always paid.


## Apps

1. **Abstraction** (*first_app*): A lesson in making the first Flutter app.
    - Just uses `StatelessWidgets` (no state of the app to be saved).
    - Minimal and the least bit of code.
    - Deals mostly with the starter concepts of reloads, widget trees, state, etc.
1. **All in All** (*addition*): A lesson in creating layouts using Material UI.
    - Still uses `StatelessWidgets` (no state of the app to be saved).
    - Focusses a lot in layouts and structure.
    - Codebase structured and organized as in standard Flutter projects.
    - Incorporates local file storage.
